# Cache - The hardware for speedup IO


Computer can store and read from memory with a very fair amount of speed. But that speed is considerably very long compared with the speed of the CPU. CPU process speed is way much faster than normal memory device IO speed.

Cache, is a type of SRAM, have the IO speed nearly equal with the CPU processing speed. So, CPU won't have to wait for the IO to finish. The hardware size of cache is usually very small. Taking the advantage of cache is one of the most important point in improving software efficency.
